# social-network-api

## User Story 

 As a social media startup
 I want an API for my network that uses a NoSQL database 
 So that my website can handle large amounts of various data 

 ## Acceptance Criteria 

 Given a social network API
 When I enter a command into my command line 
 Then my server is started and my Mongoose models are synced with that database 
 When I open Api get routes in Insomnia for users
 Then the users data is presented in JSON format 
 When I open API post, put, and delete routes in Insomnia
 Then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users in my database
